# MediTrack-App: Medicine Expiry Tracker üíä

**MediTrack** is a web-based application built with Python and Flask, designed to be a simple, reliable, and user-friendly tool for managing your medicine inventory and tracking expiry dates.

It provides a clean dashboard to log all your medications and automatically flags items that are expiring soon or have already expired, helping to ensure safety and reduce waste.

---

## üìú The Problem

In any household or small clinic, managing a stock of medicines is a common but crucial task. It's incredibly easy to lose track of expiry dates, which can lead to:
* **Health Risks:** Accidentally using expired medication that may be ineffective or even harmful.
* **Financial Waste:** Having to discard batches of unused, expired medicines.
* **Disorganization:** Not knowing what you have in stock when you need it most.

## ‚úÖ The Solution

**MediTrack** tackles this problem by providing a centralized digital inventory. Instead of relying on sticky notes or memory, you can log every medicine into this simple application.

The app's core function is its **automated alert system**. It constantly checks the current date against the expiry dates you've entered and color-codes your inventory, giving you an at-a-glance view of what needs your attention.

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **Medicine Inventory (CRUD):**
    * **Create:** Easily add new medicines to your inventory with a simple form (e.g., Name, Type, Quantity, Expiry Date).
    * **Read:** View your entire medicine stock on a single, easy-to-read dashboard.
    * **Update:** (Presumed) Ability to edit existing entries to correct mistakes or update quantities.
    * **Delete:** (Presumed) Ability to remove medicines that have been used up or discarded.
* **Automated Expiry Alerts:**
    The app's main dashboard intelligently categorizes and color-codes your medicines:
    * **Safe:** Items with a long time left before expiry.
    * **Expiring Soon:** Items that are approaching their expiry date (e.g., within the next 30 days), highlighted for attention.
    * **Expired:** Items that are past their expiry date, clearly flagged as unsafe.
* **Persistent Data:**
    Your inventory is saved in a local **SQLite** database, meaning your data persists even if you restart the application or your computer.
* **Lightweight & Web-Based:**
    Runs as a local web server, so you can access it from any browser on your computer. No complex software installation is required.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

This project is built on a simple and robust set of technologies, making it easy to run and maintain.

* **Backend:** [**Python 3**](https://www.python.org/)
    * [**Flask**](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/): A lightweight and flexible micro-framework used to build the web server, handle HTTP requests, and render the user interface.
* **Database:** [**SQLite**](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html)
    * A serverless, self-contained SQL database engine. It's perfect for small-to-medium applications as it stores the entire database in a single file (`database.db`) without needing a separate server process.
* **Frontend:**
    * **HTML5** (Jinja2 Templates): The `templates` directory contains HTML files that are rendered by Flask. [Jinja2](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/) is used to dynamically insert data (like the medicine list) into the pages.
    * **CSS3:** Found in the `static/css` directory, used for all styling to make the application look clean and user-friendly.
    * **JavaScript:** Found in the `static/js` directory, used for any client-side interactivity, like form validation or dynamic page elements.

## üìÅ Project Structure

Here is a brief overview of the key files and directories in this repository:

```

MediTrack-App/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app.py              \# The main Flask application file. This is the "brain" of the app.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ init\_db.py          \# A one-time setup script to create the database and its tables.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ database.db         \# The SQLite database file (created after running init\_db.py).
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ templates/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html      \# The main dashboard/homepage.
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...             \# Other HTML pages (e.g., "add medicine" form).
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ static/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ css/            \# Contains all CSS stylesheets.
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ js/             \# Contains all client-side JavaScript files.
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ images/         \# Contains any images used by the app.
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ .gitignore          \# (Recommended) To exclude files like **pycache** or venv.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a local copy of the project up and running on your machine.

### Prerequisites

You must have the following software installed on your system:
* [**Python 3.7+**](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* [**pip**](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/) (Python's package installer, usually included with Python)
* [**Git**](https://git-scm.com/downloads) (for cloning the repository)

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    Open your terminal or command prompt and clone this repository to your local machine.
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/niks1503/MediTrack-App.git](https://github.com/niks1503/MediTrack-App.git)
    cd MediTrack-App
    ```

2.  **Create a Virtual Environment (Highly Recommended):**
    This creates an isolated environment for the project's dependencies, so they don't interfere with your system-wide Python packages.
    
    * On macOS/Linux:
        ```bash
        python3 -m venv venv
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```
    * On Windows:
        ```bash
        python -m venv venv
        .\venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
    You'll know it's active when you see `(venv)` at the beginning of your terminal prompt.

3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    This project does not include a `requirements.txt` file, so the dependencies must be installed manually. The primary one is Flask.
    ```bash
    pip install Flask
    ```
    *(**Note for contributors:** If you add new libraries, please create a `requirements.txt` file by running `pip freeze > requirements.txt`)*

4.  **Initialize the Database:**
    Before you can run the app, you must create the database and its tables. Run the `init_db.py` script **once**.
    ```bash
    python init_db.py
    ```
    You should now see a new file named `database.db` in your project directory. **Do not delete this file**, as it contains all your data.

---

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Usage

With the setup complete, you can now run the application.

1.  **Start the Flask Server:**
    Run the `app.py` script from your terminal:
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```
    You should see output similar to this, indicating the server is running:
    ```
     * Running on [http://127.0.0.1:5000/](http://127.0.0.1:5000/) (Press CTRL+C to quit)
    ```

2.  **Open the Application:**
    Open your favorite web browser and navigate to the local address:
    **[http://127.0.0.1:5000/](http://127.0.0.1:5000/)**

3.  **Start Tracking:**
    You can now use the web interface to:
    * Add new medicines via the "Add Medicine" form.
    * View your complete inventory on the main dashboard.
    * Monitor the expiry alerts.

To stop the application, go back to your terminal and press **`CTRL+C`**.

## üí° Future Improvements

This project has a solid foundation. Here are some potential features that could be added:

* **User Accounts:** Implement user registration and login to allow multiple users to manage their own separate inventories.
* **Email/SMS Notifications:** Set up a background task to send automated email or
    SMS alerts when a medicine is about to expire.
* **Search & Filtering:** Add a search bar to quickly find specific medicines in a large inventory.
* **Categories & Locations:** Allow users to categorize medicines (e.g., "Painkiller," "Antibiotic") or add storage locations (e.g., "Bathroom Cabinet," "Fridge").
* **Data Export:** Add a feature to export the medicine list as a CSV or PDF file.
